This project is designed to be a recipe book where anyone 
can create and submit their favorite recipes. Users may also
view all recipes by category which can be seen in a nav bar.

Although I had very little experience with Firebase, I chose it
as my backend. This took quite a bit of time due to my lack
of experience.

For the layout, simple css queries were used with the exception
of the nav bar which uses Reactstrap. Reactstrap was not 
working well with the other pages, so it was removed from 
the general layout. I was unfamiliar with how to add traditional
Bootstrap to a React project.

In terms of Ajax functionality, new recipes are saved in state
before submitted to the database. When routing to a new page in 
the site, an initial fetch from the database is performed.

Unit tests was something I really struggled with. I only knew
how to write tests for the MVC setup, which this project does
not have. I didn't know how to test the functionality. The more
I reasearched, I realized that I had to use something called 
Enzyme to test React. Another component I do not understand.
So yes, there are some tests. But no, they're not amazing.
